## Project Title - COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis and Global Impact
Team Members - Hamim, Prav, Maxwell, Rukayat 

### Project Description/Outline:
Our project aims to analyze the global impact of COVID-19 vaccination efforts and provide insights into vaccination progress, distribution, and its correlation with various factors. We will utilize datasets from reputable sources such as Our World in Data and Coronavirus Tracker to gather relevant information.

### Research Questions:
1. How many people are partially vaccinated with only one dose of the COVID vaccine globally?  
2. What is the number of fully vaccinated individuals who have received both doses of the COVID vaccine worldwide?       
3. How does the vaccination progress vary across different countries or regions? Are there any disparities?    
4. Is there a correlation between the GDP per capita of a country and the percentage of its population that is fully vaccinated against COVID-19?
5. What is the current global death toll due to COVID-19?      


### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the vaccination progress varies across different countries or regions. Disparities exist, with some countries achieving higher levels of vaccination coverage than others. Higher GDP per capita generally indicates better healthcare resources, which can contribute to higher vaccination rates. It is essential to continue promoting equitable vaccine distribution and ensuring access to vaccines for all populations, regardless of economic factors

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Data Collection: Gather data on COVID-19 vaccinations and global COVID-19 statistics from the provided sources.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and ensure consistency. 
3. Visualization: Utilize JavaScript, particularly Leaflet.js, to create interactive visualizations showcasing the research questions.
4. Analysis: Analyze the data to answer the research questions and identify any correlations or insights.
5. Presentation: Create a presentation (on Powerpoint) summarising the findings and insights. Could create extra slides for appendix for more information.
